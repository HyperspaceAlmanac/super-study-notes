# super-study-notes
## Introduction
While studying to get CompTIA Linux+ certifications, I kept on coming up with ideas on how to do it more efficiently.
I feel that a lot of the note applications are kind of primitive, and that diagrams and visuals can really help
with the learning process.

Key feature will be to allow the users to attach tags to sections of the notes and to be able to quickly display
topics in hiearchy with varying amount of detail. Visualisation will be a large part of the app to display the data
in useful ways, and for there to be features such as creating flash cards from the notes.

I see opportunities for something like this to be integrated into online educational platforms.

## Planned tech stack
This will be a portfolio project. I am planning on using FlaskAlchemy + sqlite for backend, and react.js on for frontend.

## Initial Planned Features
Easy to use hierarchical tag system

Visualization of the hiearchical tag

Flash card system using the tags

Importable and exportable templates to serve as fill in the blank outlines.

Full screen, split screen, and two split screen modes
